>Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is an API for accessing the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) data. The work started at [The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org) in collaboration with GENIVI and its successor COVESA. The W3C Automotive Working Group closed in February of 2024 and the work is continuing at COVESA.

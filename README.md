## Overview

>Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is an API for accessing the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) data. The work started at [The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org) in collaboration with GENIVI and its successor COVESA. The W3C Automotive Working Group closed in February of 2024 and the work is continuing at COVESA.

To see the most recent HTML rendered version of the specifications from this repository can be found at the following:

- [COVESA VISS version 3.0 - Core](https://raw.githack.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification/main/spec/VISSv3.0_Core.html)
- [COVESA VISS version 3.0-Payload Encoding](https://raw.githack.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification/main/spec/VISSv3.0_PayloadEncoding.html)

The [VISS explainer](./VISS-explainer.md) gives some background and rationale to this interface.

## Reference Implementation

## Previous version
[VISS version 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/)

## Tools

- [ReSpec](https://www.w3.org/respec/) has been used to style the specifications allowing the editors to focus on functionality and ensure consistency and referential integrity
- The [API Design Cookbook](http://www.w3.org/TR/api-design/) has been used as a guide for the use of WebIDL

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guidelines

JavaScript should be written using the [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) rule set defined by [Echidna](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/blob/master/.jscs.json).

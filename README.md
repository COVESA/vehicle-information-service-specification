## Overview

>Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is an API for accessing the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) data. The work started at [The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org) in collaboration with GENIVI and its successor COVESA. The W3C Automotive Working Group closed in February of 2024 and the work is continuing at COVESA.

To see the most recent HTML rendered version of the specifications from this repository can be found at the following:

- [Vehicle Information Service Specification version 2 - CORE](https://raw.githack.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification/main/spec/VISSv2_Core.html) (git)
- [Vehicle Information Service Specification version 2 - TRANSPORT](https://raw.githack.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification/main/spec/VISSv2_Transport.html) (git)

The [VISS explainer](./VISS-explainer.md) gives some background and rationale to this interface.

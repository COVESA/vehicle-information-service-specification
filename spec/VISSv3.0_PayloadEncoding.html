      <p>
        The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is a
        service for accessing vehicle information, including signals from sensors
        on control units within a vehicle's network. This information is exposed through a hierarchical, 
        tree-like taxonomy as defined in the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS), 
        and is provided in JSON format. The VISS service may be hosted within the vehicle or on external servers, 
        using data that has already been off-boarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        VISS enables a broad range of use cases, including predictive maintenance, usage-based insurance, fleet management, 
        and real-time driver assistance services.
        In the context of artificial intelligence, VISS serves as a critical data access layer, providing high-quality, 
        real-time vehicle data that can be utilized by AI algorithms for tasks such as anomaly detection, 
        driver behavior analysis, energy optimization, and contextual decision-making.
      </p>  
      <p>
        This specification describes the third version of VISS, which
        has been implemented and deployed in production vehicles.
        The first version of VISS supported only WebSocket as a
        transport protocol, the second version is generalized to work
        across different protocols as some are better suited for
        different use cases.
        The second version added support for the HTTP and MQTT transport
        protocols, improved subscription capabilities and added an
        access control mechanism.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There are three parts to this specification, [[CORE]], [[TRANSPORT]], and PAYLOAD ENCODING. This document, the VISS version 3.0 PAYLOAD ENCODING specification, 
        describes the VISSv3.0 payload encodings that is used in some cases. 
        The companion specifications [[CORE]] describes the messaging layer,
        and [[TRANSPORT]] describes the deviations form the CORE specification that are used by some transport protocols.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
      The acronym 'VISSv3.0' is used to refer to this document, the VISS version 3.0 specification.
      The acronym 'VSS' is used to refer to the <a href="https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification">'Vehicle Signal Specification'</a>
      which is hosted by COVESA.
      The term 'WebSocket' when used in this specification, is as defined in the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">W3C WebSocket API</a> and [[RFC6455]], the WebSocket Protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

      <section id="transport-payload">
        <h2>Transport Payload</h2>
        <p>The payload primary format is JSON. This means that the payloads received by a client SHALL have the JSON format,
        unless an implementation deliberately deviates from this.
        Refer to the [[CORE]] specification for the JSON payload format of the messages for the different transport protocols.

      <section id="protobuf-encoding">
        <h2>Protobuf encoding</h2>
          <p>Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data, developed by Google. 
            This encoding method is particularly beneficial for efficient data serialization and deserialization, ensuring low latency and reduced payload size, 
            which are crucial for vehicle information services.
          </p>
          <p>The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) defines a standard protocol for accessing vehicle data in a standardized manner. 
            As vehicles become more connected and data-driven, the need for efficient data exchange methods becomes paramount. 
            Protobuf encoding serves as an optimal solution within VISS due to its compact binary format and schema evolution capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>In this section, we outline the integration of Protobuf encoding with VISS version 3.0, providing comprehensive details on schema definitions, 
            encoding and decoding processes, and practical examples. This will enable seamless implementation and interoperability across different systems and 
            platforms within the automotive ecosystem.
          </p>

          <section id="protobuf-Schema-definition">
            <h2>Protobuf Schema Definition</h2>
            <p>
            The following protobuf schema defines the VISS message payloads.
            When saved in a file (e.g., named "viss.proto"), the Protobuf compiler (protoc) can be used to create helper functions that can be called to encode and decode
            between the JSON and Protobuf formats.
            The protobuf schema below also contains a "service" clause that the protoc compiler uses to create a gRPC based communication framework.
            </p>

          <section id="transport-protocol-realizations">
            <h2>Transport Protocol Realizations</h2>
            <p> This part outlines how Protobuf encoding is realized across various transport protocols, including gRPC, WebSocket, and MQTT.
            </p>

            <section id="grpc-realization">
              <h2>gRPC Realization</h2>
              <p>
                The 'service' clause in the Protobuf schema is used by the Protobuf compiler(protoc) to automatically generate code for gRPC-based communication. 
                This generated code simplifies the development of server and client interactions by abstracting the network communication layer, 
                allowing developers to focus on the application logic.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="websocket-realization">
              <h2>Websocket Realization</h2>
              <p>
              If a server supports protobuf payload encoding over the Websocket protocol, it SHALL be shown in the server capabilities data
              how the client configures this. Two mechanisms are defined:
            <ul>
              <li>Separate port number. The recommended port number is 6444.</li>
              <li>A sub-protocol MUST be specified when connecting to the server, The recommended sub-protocol name is "VISS-protoenc".</li>
            </ul>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="mqtt-realization">
              <h2>MQTT Realization</h2>
              <p>
              If a server supports protobuf payload encoding over the MQTT protocol, it SHALL be shown in the server capabilities data
              which topic name that the server uses to listen for clients that want to issue requests with protobuf encoded payloads.
              The recommended topic name is the topic name used for the unencoded payload channel appended with the string "/protobuf".
              </p>
            </section>

          </section>

          <section id="encoding-and-decoding-with-protobuf">
            <h2>Encoding and Decoding with Protobuf</h2>
            <p>
            The protobuf compiler uses the protobuf schema to generate an API to helper functions that can be used to implement the encoding and decoding
            between JSON and the protobuf format for the various VISS messages.
            The implementation of the encoding and the decoding is out-of-scope for this specification.
            </p>
          </section>   
        </section>

          <section id="json-schema-based-encoding">
            <h2>JSON schema based encoding</h2>
            <p>
              Several Interface Definition Languages (IDLs), such as OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, can utilize a JSON Schema representation as input.
              The JSON scheme representation of the VISSv3.0 interface in the [[CORE]] specification can be used for such a purpose.

    <section id='abstract'>
      <p>The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) is a
      service for accessing vehicle information, signals from sensors
      on control units within a vehicle's network. It exposes this
      information using a hierarchical tree like taxonomy defined in
      COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). The service provides
      this information in JSON format. The service may reside in the
      vehicle, or on servers in the internet with information
      already brought off the vehicle.</p>

      <p>This specification describes a third version of VISS which
      has been implemented and deployed on production vehicles.
      The first version of VISS only supported WebSocket as a
      transport protocol, the second version is generalized to work
      across different protocols as some are better suited for
      different use cases.
      The second version added support for the HTTP and MQTT transport
      protocols, subscription capabilities was improved and an
      access control solution was added.</p>

      <p>
        There are three parts to this specification, CORE, [[TRANSPORT]], and [[PAYLOAD ENCODING]]. This document, the VISS version 3.0 CORE specification,
        describes the VISSv3.0 messaging layer.<br>
        The VISSv3.0 transport protocol examples document describes the deviations from the CORE definitions that are used in some transport protocols.
        It also examplifies the JSON primary payload format using the Websocket payloads.<br>
        The VISSv3.0 payload encoding document describes payload encoding designs that may be applied e. g. for payloads in transit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes the messaging API for the VISS protocol.
        This includes the messaging layer and set of rules for structuring data.<br>
        The specification is agnostic to which transport protocol that is used as long as it conforms to this messaging API and data rule set.
        Transport protocols that cannot conform to the entire CORE specification can still be conformant by describing their deviations in the
        [[TRANSPORT]] specification.<br>
        The primary payload data format is JSON. The JSON schema (<a href="#json-schema"></a>) defines all of the payloads.
        If a transport protocol uses a different payload encoding, such as gRPC,
        or a more bandwidth efficient data representation is desired, then this encoding may be defined in the [[PAYLOAD ENCODING]] document.
        This encoding must contain a solution for both encoding of the JSON payloads and decoding back to the JSON format.
        A client MUST be able to access the message payload in the JSON format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The messages are exchanged between a server implementation holding the representation of data
        and a client using the data as shown in the figure below, where the payload also is encoded when in transit over the transport protocol.
      </p>
        <figure id="fig-payload-encoding">

          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">VISSv3 payload encoding overview.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
      <p>
        The VISSv3.0 messaging layer builds on RESTful principles for the method exchange via the interface (<a href="#interface"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The VISSv3.0 data structuring rules (<a href="https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/">VSS Rule set</a>)
        are the same through all transport protocols.
        The basis for structuring data held by a server is a tree structure.

    <section id="data-model">
      <h2>Data Model</h2>
                <p>The service is intended for use with a tree-like logical taxonomy to represent the vehicle data.
                An illustrative example of such a tree structure is shown in <a href="#fig-example-vss-tree">Figure 1</a>.
                While it is meant to support conforming taxonomies it was created principally with the
                <a href="https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification">Vehicle Signal Specification</a> (VSS) in mind.
                For more details, see the <a href="http://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/">VSS documentation</a>.<br>
                Depending on how VISS is being used, for instance to serve data already off-boarded and residing in the cloud,
                it may make sense to allow sensor values to be updated by sending a 'set' request.
                When VISS is directly on the vehicle, values reported by sensors are authoritative and should be read-only within VISS.
                Implementations should handle set requests appropriately for their situation and respond with appropriate success or error messages accordingly.
                </p>

      <section id="address">
        <h2>Addressing</h2>
        <p>Addressing of resources is done using URIs as defined in [[RFC3987]].<br>
        <blockquote><a>scheme</a>://<a>authority</a>/<a>path</a>?<a>query</a></blockquote>
        The <dfn>scheme</dfn> describes the protocol to use to reach the addressed resource.
        For supported protocols, see the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://raw.githack.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification/main/spec/VISSv3.0_Transport.html#transport-protocols">transport protocols</a> in [[TRANSPORT]] specification.<br>
        The <dfn>authority</dfn> describes where to reach the resource, for more details see <a href="#authority-component"></a>.<br>
        The <dfn>path</dfn> addresses a specific service within the resource, for more details see <a href="#path-component"></a>.<br>
        The <dfn>query</dfn> contains further information related to the addressed service, see <a href="#filter-request"></a>.<br>
        There are potentially three resources for which a client needs a URI, see <a href="#architecture"></a>:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>VISSv3 server.</li>
            <li>Access grant token server.</li>
            <li>Access token server.</li>

      <section id="authority-component">
        <h2>Authority URI Component</h2>
        <p>
          The authority component of the URI consists of an IP address or a domain name followed by a colon and a port number.
        </p>

        <section id="ip-address-domain-name">
          <h2>IP address / domain name</h2>
          <p>
          Depending on the deployment of a resource, either in the cloud or in a vehicle, they will have a domain name or an IP address, respectively.
          A client is expected to obtain this part of the authority component via an interaction with the
          <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>. The details of this interaction is out of scope for this specification.

          <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
          <p>
          The VISSv3 server shall use the following port numbers for the different transport protocols.
          <ul>
            <li>HTTP port number = 443.</li>
            <li>Websocket port number = 6443.</li>

          </ul>
          The access grant token server shall use the port number 7443.<br>
          The access token server shall use the port number 8443.<br>
          A client may be provisioned with other port numbers than the above specified in its interaction

      </section>

      <section id="path-component">
        <h2>Path URI Component</h2>
        <p>
          The path URI component definition differs between the three resources.<br>
          For the <b>VISSv3 server</b> the definition is as follows.<br>
          The path consists of a sequence of VSS node names separated by a delimiter. VSS specifies the dot (.) as delimiter,
          which therefore is the recommended choice also in this specification.
          However, in HTTP URLs the conventional delimiter is slash (/), therefore also this delimiter is supported.
          To exemplify, the path expression from traversing the nodes Vehicle, Car, Engine, RPM can  be "Vehicle.Car.Engine.RPM",
          or "Vehicle/Car/Engine/RPM". A mix of delimiters in the same path expression SHOULD be avoided.<br>
          The path MUST not contain any wildcard characters ("*"), for such needs see <a href="#paths-filter-operation"></a>.<br>
          For the <b>access grant token server</b> the path is "agts".<br>
          For the <b>access token server</b> the path is "ats".<br>
        </p>
      </section>
      </section>

      <section id="data-representation">
        <h2>Data representation</h2>
        <p>
          A single data point is in the message payload represented by a value and an associated timestamp,
          in JSON represented by two key-value pairs with the key names "value" and "ts".<br>
          The "ts" value MUST be a string as specified in <a href="#timestamp"></a>.<br>
          The "value" value MUST be represented as a string for simple datatypes.
          If the value is an array it MUST be represented as a JSON array of strings.
          In the case the value is a struct complex datatype it MUST be represented as a JSON object, see below.
          For supported datatypes see <a href="https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/data_entry/data_types/">VSS Data Types</a>.<br>
          Number values MUST follow the number formats as specified in [[RFC8259]], but as stated above represented as a string.
          Boolean values MUST be represented by either of the strings "true" or "false".<br>
          The struct complex datatype MUST be represented as a JSON object as shown below.
          A struct with the following declaration
          <pre><code>
          struct {
              field1 datatype
              field2 datatype
          }
          </code></pre>
          is represented by the following JSON object
          <pre><code>
          {"field1":"X", "field2":"Y"}
          </code></pre>
          where X and Y are the actual values of respective datatype.
          The datatype of a field of the struct may be any datatype supported by VSS, including a struct.<br>
          For representation of multiple data points, see <a href="#response-syntax"></a>.<br>
          If data is represented incorrectly, then an error message with number 400, and reason "Bad data" MUST be returned.
          A specific case of this is if an array of data elements does not contain the number expected by the server.
          The server MAY then respond successfully, and follow a proprietary recovery policy,
          or it MAY respond with error number 400, and reason "Invalid array size".

        In addition to some privacy provisions within the specification itself, COVESA and W3C have activities seeking
	to establish systems and guidelines to provide further considerations for handling of information.
        </p>

        <p>
        For some uses, such as when information is only referenced within the vehicle not sent
        off nor persisting between restarts, there should be little to no privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
        This specification has granular access control capabilities to limit what information an application may access.
        All information sent from a VISS service to client application must be transported over an
        encrypted protocol to help protect privacy.
        </p>

        <p>
        A client accessing vehicle data may require consent from whoever is deemed authoritative for a given
        jurisdiction and ownership situation.
        This specification enables an External Consent Framework to connect to a VISS server to realize this functionality,
        see <a href="#consent-support"></a>.
        That consent should be revocable. Revoking it is outside the scope of this specification,
        it is expected to be handled out of band and in some cases by regulations and contractual commitments.

      <h2>Filter Request</h2>
          <p>
          Filtering is a mechanism to refine a client request, in order to more precisely control what is returned in a response.
          Filtering can be applied in read requests and in subscribe requests.
          A request where filtering is applied has the following structure
          <ul>
          <li>for the HTTP protocol:
          <ul>
          <li>GET /&lt;vsspath&gt;?filter=&lt;filter-expression&gt;</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>for any protocol using the primary JSON payload format:
          <ul>
          <li>{"action":"get", "path":"&lt;vsspath&gt;", "filter":"&lt;filter-expression&gt;"}</li>
          </ul></li>
          </ul>
          where<br>
          <ul>
          <li>Get is the transport protocol method,</li>
          <li>vsspath is the path starting from the tree root,</li>
          <li>filter is the key name for the filter expression,</li>
          <li>filter-expression contains the filter instructions.</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
          The filter expression has the object format as shown below. For the case of an optional second object of this type,
          these are enclosed in an array expression.<br>
          <ul>
          <li>{"variant":"&lt;x&gt;", "parameter":"&lt;y&gt;"}</li>
          </ul>
          where<br>
          <ul>
          <li><b>variant</b>: the key name for the filter operation variant, which can have one of the values:

          <ul>
          <li>one or more relative paths. In the case of several paths an array expression shall be used.</li>

          <li><b>parameter</b>: the key name for the optional configuration data that the filter operation requires.
          The parameter data varies depending on the variant,
          is enclosed in one object, or optionally an array of two objects, and is described in the following chapters.</li>
          </ul>
          The server MUST support the timebased and change variants, the other variants are optional.<br>
          In the JSON object, the key-value pairs "variant" and "parameter" must always be present.
          The JSON expression may consist of maximum one object with variant "paths", plus maximum one object with any other supported variant,
          which are then logically combined as with an AND operator.<br>
          The variants timebased, range, change, and curvelog are only applicable for subscription requests.
          Subscription requests are not supported by the HTTP transport protocol.<br>
          The restriction on how many objects that can be combined is also set by the URL size restriction on 1k characters (*).<br>
          (*) 1k is the "conservative limit, which should always be supported, a more liberal limit is 2k, which is supported in most cases.

                <p>
                The paths filter operation is used when a single request is used to retrieve signal data from multiple data points in the VSS tree.
                The vsspath shall point to the last node in the tree that is common for the relative paths in the filter parameter object,
                that start off from this node.
                If the end point of a path in the filter value is a branch, then all leaf nodes in the sub-tree below this branch are addressed.
                A path in the filter value may contain the wildcard character (*) as a representative for a single path segment.<br>
                Every path element in a value array must address at least one node in the tree, or else an error message shall be returned.<br>
                Different elements of the value array may address the same node,
                in which case it is the responsibility of the server to resolve this to a singleton in the event messages.<br>

        <h2>History Filter Operation</h2>
                <p>
                The server typically have access only to the latest, most fresh data point representing a signal.
                However, it may for various reasons at least temporarily have access to also older data points.
                A scenario where this could occur is when a vehicle temporarily loses its connectivity,
                maybe because it enters into a tunnel. Assuming that the vehicle detects the loss of connectivity, it may then start to record data.
                If recorded, this data may then be accessed using the history variant.
                The vehicle system makes its own decision whether to record any data, and for how long this data will be kept in storage.
                The period in the filter expression goes from current time, excluding the current value, and backwards in time.
                The number of data points in the response depends on the period size, and the sample frequency.
                The latter can not be set by the client,
                so the client should have some understanding of its value to estimate the amount of data it may receive.
                A request for historic data will return a Not found error (404) if historic data is unavailable.
                The period must conform to the [[ISO8601]] duration format, expressed with days, hour, minute,
                and second data, i. e. "parameter": "PdddDThhHmmMssS".
                The number of days shall be less than 999. Only a single period can be expressed.<br>

        The metadata request is used when the client instead of the data associated to VSS node(s)
        wants to retrieve meta data associated to the VSS node(s).<br>
        The metadata is retrieved from the VSS tree that is deployed in the vehicle.
        This request variant is sometimes referred to as a signal discovery request.
        If the "parameter" object contains an empty string, then all metadata that the server can retrieve for the for the addressed node(s) are returned,
        while if it contains a metadata key name, or an array of key names, then only the selected metadata is returned.<br>
        For the set of metadata key names,
        see the <a href="https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification">Vehicle Signal Specification</a>.<br>
        The vsspath in the request may point to either a leaf node, or to a branch node.
        In the latter case then the response will contain metadata from the entire sub-tree having this branch as the root.<br>
        A metadata request can be combined with a paths filter operation to address multiple nodes,
        but cannot be combined with any other filter variant.<br>
        The response is a JSON formatted object with corresponding key-value pairs per addressed node.
        The server MAY support the metadata request.<br>

          <h2>Response syntax</h2>
            <p>
            A response may contain multiple values, due to either that multiple nodes are addressed,
            or to that multiple values for one signal is returned.
            These two reasons can be combined, leading to four different cases.
                <ul>

                The syntax to accomodate these four cases have a common structure where a data point ("dp") consists of one or more objects
                containing a "value" and a timestamp ("ts"), and the complete aggregation ("data"),
                consists of one or more objects containing a "path" and a data point (dp"). The syntax of the four cases are shown below.
                <p>Response for a single value from a single node:
        <pre class="highlight hljs javascript" aria-busy="false">

               In the case of a request for multiple values from multiple nodes, the data point for different paths may contain single or multiple objects,
               as the vehicle system may not have multiple values recorded for all requested signals.

     <section id="subscription-event-triggering">
          <h2>Subscription Event Triggering</h2>
            <p>
            A subscription request must always contain a filter operation that describes the trigger event that leads to
            that the server dispatches an asynchronous event message.
            For the filter variants "range" or "change", the triggering is dependent on the signal value.
            When the request addresses multiple signals, the triggering condition shall only be evaluated on one of the signals,
            which is the first signal in the parameter array of paths.
            The first path in the array must therefore not contain wildcards to address multiple signals.
            In this case one of the path addresses in the wildcard expression must be selected as the first array element,
            which can then be followed by the wildcard expression.
            The duplicate reference to one signal that this leads to shall be resolved by the server to a singleton in the event messages.

      Access control SHALL not be applied to the VSS nodes containing the VSS version data,

      <section id="architecture">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The VISSv3 access control model is inspired by the concepts of OAuth2.0 [[RFC6749]],
        but some deviations exist as is described in the following chapters.<br><br>
        Four actors are defined:<br>
        <b>Client</b><br>
        An <a href="#application-roles-def">application </a>making protected and authorized resource requests on behalf of its
        <a href="#user-roles-def">user</a>.<br>
        <b>Access grant token server</b><br>
        The server issuing the Access Grant credential after successfully authenticating the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br>
        <b>Access token server</b><br>
        The server issuing the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> to the <a href="#client-def">client</a>
        after successfully validating the request and obtaining authorization.<br>
        <b>VISSv3 server</b><br>
        The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using
        <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>.<br><br>
        The abstract protocol flow illustrated in the figure below describes the interaction between the four actors.<br>
        <figure id="fig-oauth2.0-flow">
          <img src="images/VISSv3-abstract-flow.jpg" alt="VISSv3 abstract protocol flow.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">The abstract protocol flow.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        Besides the four actors directly involved in the abstract flow, there are two more actors.<br>
        <b>Resource owner</b><br>
        This is typically the driver of the vehicle, who may be asked for consent before access is granted.<br>
        <b>Ecosystem manager</b><br>
        The entity managing the access control ecosystem. It controls the Policy documents,
        and manages the PKI ecosystem that the other actors may utilize.<br><br>
        The abstract protocol flow is implemented by two different flows, as will be described in the following chapters.<br>
        The process to obtain the credentials needed for <a href="#client-def">client</a> authentication is out-of-scope,
        as well as the installation procedures for the <a href="#application-roles-def">applications</a>.

      </section>

      <section id="access-control-flows">
        <h2>Protocol Flows</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        Two different flows are described. Which flow to use depends on the capabilities of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br>
        If a <a href="#client-def">client</a> is able to run public key cryptographic primitives,
        i.e. key pair generation and signatures,
        and has access to some kind of trusted execution environment where private keys are protected from the regular execution environment,
        then it can use the long term flow. <a href="#client-def">Clients</a> that do not have access to these capabilities,
        or do not want to use them, must select the short term flow.<br>
        The advantage of using the long term flow is that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> can be trusted with longer expiry times of
        <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>.
        In the short term flow the <a href="#client-def">client</a> must due to a shorter expiry time contact the
        <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> more often to obtain a new
        <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.<br>
        A <a href="#client-def">client</a> selects the type of flow by either submitting a public key in the
        <a href="#access-grant-request-def">access grant request</a>, or not. The latter leading to an short term flow.

          The client may have to issue several requests before an access token can be obtained, even in the case of having a valid access grant token.
          The reason for this is that if consent is required, the ATS will forward the consent request to the External Consent Framework,
          and it is likely that there will not be an immediate response from the <a>ECF</a>.
          The ATS will then on the initial access token request respond to the client with a session handle that the client must use in subsequent requests for the access token.
          When the ATS has obtained a consent reply from the <a>ECF</a> it can thereafter following client inquiry request in the case of a positive consent
          respond with the access token, or in the case of a negative consent respond with only the negative consent result.

        <h2>Access Grant Token Server</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
          The access grant token server is in charge of producing <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> to
          <a href="#client-def">clients</a>.<br>
          Depending on the capabilities of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>, the specification supports two types of
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>: Short term and long term
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>.<br>
          Long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>,
          are supported for those <a href="#client-def">clients</a> able to run public key cryptographic primitives,
          i.e. key pair generation and signatures,
          and is the recommended choice for <a href="#client-def">clients</a> with access to a trusted execution environment where
          private keys are protected from the regular execution environment.
          The specification also supports short term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> that require
          no extra capabilities in the client,
          but due to its shorter expiry time it forces the client to contact the access grant token server more often before
          <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> requests for an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.<br>
          The <a href="#client-def">client</a> request shall contain the following:
          <ul>
            <li>A <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.</li>
            <li>A set of <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          In scenarios where both the client and the access grant token server are deployed in-vehicle the VIN parameter may be omitted,
          in all other deployment scenarios it shall be present.
          <ul>
            <li>A VIN.</li>
          </ul>
          When a VIN is present in the request, the vehicle identity (vin) claim shall be present in the
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.<br>
          If the <a href="#client-def">client</a> needs a long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>,
          then the request shall also contain:
          <ul>
            <li>A public key.</li>
          </ul>
          The Vehicle identification number shall be for the vehicle that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> wants to access.<br>
          The <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> contains all relevant information from the client,
          i.e. for each of the three sub-actors that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> represents.<br>
          The <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a> are to be used for verifying the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.<br>
          The public key shall be generated by the <a href="#client-def">client</a>,
          and the associated private key must be under control of the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.<br><br>
          The main responsibilities of the access grant token server are:
          <ul>
            <li>To verify the <a href="#client-context-def"> client context</a>, and assess that their respective role request can be granted.</li>
            <li>To check that the vehicle represented by the VIN belong to this Ecosystem, and is accessible.</li>
            <li>To create an <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          The <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proofs</a> may include certificates from a Certificate Authority known by the
          access grant token server.
          For example, users might authenticate themselves using X.509 identity certificates and roles might be issued using attribute certificates.
          In those cases, as part of the authentication protocol,
          the access grant token server shall also validate the certificates signatures.<br>
          The access grant token server may contact the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a> for checking the VIN.<br>
          The <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> generation is defined in the corresponding chapter.

            <li><a>Purpose</a>.</li>

        For long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, i.e. those including a public key, the
        <a href="#client-def">client</a> must also include a <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proof of possession</a>,
        for the corresponding private key, in the request.<br>
        The <a>purpose</a> must be supported by the <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>, and thus be on the
        <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>.
        The <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> associates a set of accessible signals to the <a>purpose</a>,
        thus realizing the principle of least privilege.<br>
        The main responsibilities of the access token server are:
          <ul>
            <li>To validate the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.</li>
            <li>To validate that the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> provides permission for the requested <a>purpose</a>.</li>
            <li>To create an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        The validation of the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> consists of at least the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Signature validation.</li>
            <li>Expiry time check.</li>
          </ul>
        Additionally, for long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a>, the access token server needs to verify the
        <a href="#proof-of-possession-def">proof of possession</a> using the public key contained in the token.<br>
        The <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> signature validation is done with the
        <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> public key.
        <br>
        To allow for some time synchronization inaccuracy and minor network latency,
        expiry times should be set to include potential modest margin of error, possibly as long as tens of seconds.<br>
        If a vehicle identity claim (vin) is present in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>,
        the vehicle identity (vin) claim SHALL be included in the access token.<br>
        If the <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a> as declared in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>
        does not match in the set of allowed roles for the requested <a>purpose</a> in the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>,

        <h2>Access Control Server</h2>
        <p>
        The VISSv3 server MUST support validation of <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>.
        The functionality needed for this is decribed in this chapter.
        This includes validation of at least the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Token signature.</li>
            <li>Token expiry time.</li>
          </ul>
          If a vehicle identity claim (vin) is present in the token, then it MUST be validated to match the identity of this vehicle.<br>
          If any of the mentioned validations fail, the server MUST reject the access request.<br>
          Token signature validation may be delegated to the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>,
          if a secure communication link can be established.
          If not delegated, then a preprovisioned common secret may be shared with the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>,
          or other PKI based solutions may be used.<br>
          The VISSv3 server SHALL have access to a secure system time, that cannot be modified by actors without system acknowledged credentials.
          Time validation may allow for a time synchronization inaccuracy in the range of tens of seconds.<br>
          After a successful token validation, the server MUST check that the scope of the token is compatible with the request.
          If the scope claim of the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> contains a <a>purpose</a> short-name, successful validation requires that all the nodes addressed by the path in the request MUST
          be matched by the paths associated with the <a>purpose</a> in the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> .<br>
          If the scope claim of the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> contains a explicit list of signals, successful validation requires that all the nodes addressed by the path in the request MUST
          be matched by the one of the signals included in the token.<br>
          Validation of the <a href="#device-roles-def">device</a> and <a href="#application-roles-def">app </a>roles may involve MAC address checks,
          or message round-trip measurements.<br>
          The access permission validation MUST have the outcome shown in the table below,
          when comparing the type of the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request with the access control mode either in the
          <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a> or the explicit signals that are associated to the scope claim in the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.
          If the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request contains several signals, and one fails the validation,
          then the entire request MUST be rejected.<br><br>

          The <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> need to be refreshed periodically, which is controlled by the expiry time.
          If the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> that the <a href="#client-def">client</a> used to obtain the now expired
          <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> is not expired,
          then the <a href="#client-def">client</a> can revisit the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> with this
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> to obtain a new <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>.<br>
          If the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> is expired, then the <a href="#client-def">client</a> must obtain a new
          <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a> first,
          before revisiting the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a>.<br>
          The server SHOULD support caching of a limited number of <a href="#access-token-def">access tokens</a>.
          The <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> MUST be included in the cache after a first successful request and
          MUST be removed once they expire.
          If an access token is cached then the server shall return a token handle of at least 24 bytes long.
          The client may then use this instead of the complete access token in following requests that require this access token.
          If the client decides to include the access token handle in a request, the server must then fetch the corresponding access token from the cache,
          and verify its validity before deciding to grant the request.<br>
          The server might decide to remove any token from the cache. In the case this token is then referred to with a token handle the client will get a "401,
          missing_token" error and will be forced to send the whole <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> again.
          For <a href="#client-def">client</a> requests that are not granted due to access control,
          the VISSv3 server MUST return one of the error codes shown in the table below.<br>

          <h2>Proof of Possession</h2>
          <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>

          <p>
            Long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant tokens</a> need to be accompanied by a Proof of Possession (PoP)
            for the private key corresponding to the public key included in the <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.
            This requirement enables a longer validity for this kind of tokens, ranging from a few days to a even a year.
            By adding the PoP, an eavesdropper is prevented to reuse an <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> request,
            impersonating the client. Without a PoP, the longer the validity of an <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>,
            the higher the risk an attacker could intercept and reuse it.
            PoP for JWT are defined in [[RFC7800]], but in essence,
            a PoP enables the requester to proof to the server that it has access to a private key, without disclosing it.
            Traditionally that would require the server to create a random challenge, or nonce, and ask the client to sign it with its private key.
            Along with the public key,
            the server would be able to verify the PoP.
            This scheme would require an extra step in the protocols, where the client ask for the nonce.
          </p><p>
            In order to avoid this extra step, the client can generate the nonce itself. The server would need to check that nonces are not reused.
            Although logging previous nonces at the server side would work for small environments,
            the use of an incremental nonce in the form of a timestamp is proposed.
            One of the drawbacks of this proposal is that the server has no means to check whether the PoP has been precomputed or not.
            However, this is irrelevant from the eavesdropper point of view.
          </p><p>
            In case freshness of the PoP was a critical requirement, a public source of randomness to obtain the nonce could be used,
            e.g. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/leagueofentropy/">Leage of Entropy</a> or
            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">Interoperable Randomness Beacons</a>.
            That would provide the server a mean to check freshness of the PoP but on the other hand,
            it would require the client to access the public source of randomness every time it needs to create a PoP
            which is against the main design goals for the long term <a href="#access-grant-token-def">access grant token</a>.

        <h2>Client Context</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        The client context contains a <a href="#client-def">client</a> actor that is characterized by three subactors:
          <ul>
            <li>The <a href="#user-roles-def">user</a> of the application.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#application-roles-def">application</a>.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#device-roles-def">device</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          Each of these subactors is in turn characterized by a role,
          building on the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model</a>.
          The set of these three roles is called the Client context.<br>
          VISSv3 specifies a rudimentary list of roles for each subactor, it is expected that these lists are augmented by the
          <a href="#ecosystem-manager-def">ecosystem manager</a>, hopefully in a cooperative effort.<br>
          Using an RBAC model provides the following main purposes in the VISSv3 access control model:
          <ul>
            <li>Input to the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> in the
            <a href="#client-def">client</a> authentication process.</li>
            <li>Input to the <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> in the <a>purpose</a> validation.</li>
          </ul>
        The <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> must in the authentication process of the client
        possibly separately authenticate each of the three subactors.
        For the <a href="#access-grant-server-def">access grant token server</a> to decide on which authentication method to use per subactor
        can be quite complex, but may be somewhat eased by the <a href="#client-def">client</a> request for roles for each subactor.<br>
        Following the principle of least priviledge, a <a href="#client-def">client</a> should not have access to more vehicle signals than necessary.
        This is achieved by the <a href="#purpose-list-def">purpose list</a>, that assigns only the for the
        <a>purpose</a> relevant signals to the <a href="#client-def">client</a>.

        <h2>Access Control Selection</h2>
        <p>
        <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
        This chapter describes a complementary functionality to the access control model, the ability to apply it selectively to parts of the tree.
        It can be used in cases where not all nodes of the tree are believed to require access control,
        or where write-only validation is sufficient instead of read-write validation for certain nodes.<br>
        This functionality requires that the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a> specifies whether the access permission granted to the
        <a href="#client-def">client</a> to a signal is read-only, or read-write.
        It also requires that the metadata for the node in the VSS tree contains data specifying whether
        the access control verification should be carried out only for write request, or for both read and write requests.<br>
        The former requirement is realized as described in earlier chapters by that the <a href="#access-token-def">access token</a>
        scope claim links to a <a>purpose</a> where the signals and their respective access permission are found.<br>
        The latter requirement is realized by adding to nodes in the VSS tree the key-value pair "validate":'access-control-mode',
        where 'access-control-mode' is either the string "write-only", or "read-write".<br>
        <figure id="fig-access-control-selection">
          <img src="images/access-control-selection.jpg" alt="Access control selection tagging.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Access control selection tagging.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        The figure above shows an example where both read and write requests to the three leftmost leaf nodes will be access controlled,
        while the two rightmost leaf nodes only will be access controlled for write requests.
        An inheritance rule leads to that any nodes below a tagged node are assigned the same access control, if they are untagged.<br>
        This metadata is not likely to be applied to the standardised VSS tree,
        as different implementers of this standard may have different views on which nodes to apply it to.
        Instead it is anticipated that it is applied at a "deployment" stage, possibly using the VSS layering concept.<br>
        The inheritance model, which says that if access-control-mode data is added to a node,
        then all nodes in the subtree for which this node is the root inherits the setting,
        unless there is access-control-mode data added to any node in this subtree,
        makes possible a reduction of the number of nodes this metadata have to be added to.<br>
        This allows for example an entire VSS tree to be assigned an access-control-mode by merely applying it in the root of the tree.<br>
        The figure below shows an overview of the access control selection model,
        and a table showing the required access control tagging of a node for the VISSv3 server to grant the requested access.
        <figure id="fig-access-control-selection-model">

        </figure>
        If the VSS tree used by a VISSv3 server contains access control selection tags,
        then the server MUST support their usage as described in this chapter.<br>
        If it is not used, then a server may implement access control for the entire tree.<br>

    <section id="consent-support">
      <h2>Consent support</h2>
      <em>This section is non-normative.</em><br>
      <p>
      Handling of consent involves vehicle and cloud architectural subsystems that is out of scope in VISSv3.
      However, a VISSv3 vehicle server has a capability to enforce consent results, i. e. to allow or block access to requested data.
      This can be leveraged in a model where the server receives consent results from an <a>ECF</a> and uses that information to either grant client requests,
      or not, for data that is consent protected. How the <a>ECF</a> obtains the consent status is out-of-scope in this specification.
      A secure, local communication channel shall exist between the <a>ECF</a> and the server as shown in the figure below,
      over which the server can inquire about the consent status for data requested by a client.
      <figure id="fig-consent-architecture">
        <img src="images/consent-architecture.jpg" alt="Consent architecture.">
        <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Consent architecture.</span></figcaption>
      </figure>
      The <a>ECF</a> is responsible for the lifetime management of the consent status for all data that is managed by the server, which may involve initialization,
      event based update, consent status removal.<br>
      The consent status can be set to any of the following values:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>NOT_SET // the server must request the <a>ECF</a> for the status. Unless an immediate <a>ECF</a> response is given,
            the server must deny any client request with an error code that shows the reason.</li>
            <li>NO  // the server must deny any client request with an error code that shows the reason.</li>
            <li>IN_VEHICLE // the server shall serve the client request. The client is not allowed to off-board the data.</li>
            <li>YES // the server shall serve the client request. The client is allowed to off-board the data.</li>
        </ul>
      It shall be possible for the <a>ECF</a> to cancel a valid consent, which shall lead to the consent status being set to NOT_SET.
      Any consequences to the data provided to the client prior to the cancelling is out of scope.<br>
      In the case of a client request requiring a consent for data to be returned, it is the responsibility of the
      <a href="#access-token-server-def">access token server</a> to obtain it from the <a>ECF</a> during the dialogue with a client requesting an access token.
      This is done by issuing a request to the <a>ECF</a> which shall contain the following information:
        <ul>
            <li>The requested data.</li>
            <li>The purpose of the request.</li>
            <li>The <a href="#client-context-def">client context</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      The response from the <a>ECF</a> shall contain:
        <ul>
            <li>Consent status.</li>
        </ul>
      If the received consent status is set to NO or NOT_SET, then the access token server must not provide a valid access token to the requesting client.
      The server must store the consent status that it receives from the <a>ECF</a>, together with the data from the request for the duration of the associated service,
      or until a consent cancellation is received.<br>
      Whether a server shall take action to obtain a consent or not shall be signalled in the VSS tree.
      This is done by tagging appropriate nodes in the VSS tree extending the model used for access control selection.
      The key-value pair used for tagging of access control is suffixed with "+consent" as shown in the example below:
        <ul>
            <li>"validate":"read-write+consent"</li>
        </ul>
      The consent tagging follows the same inheritance rules as defined for the access control tagging.

        <h2>External Consent Framework Interface</h2>
        <p>
         A server receiving a client request that involves obtaining a consent status shall send a request to the <a>ECF</a>
         on which it shall receive a response containing the consent status.

         The request shall contain the data from the list in the previous chapter.

         The response shall contain the data shown in the table above.

         This communication shall be carried out using a secure channel (e.g. TLS).

          <h2>File Transfer</h2>
          <em>This appendix is non-normative.</em><br>
          <p>
          File transfer use cases, where a client either sends or receives a file from the vehicle server,
          can e. g. be a client that wants to push a map to the vehicle, or a client that wants to receive a video recording clip from the vehicle.<br>
          File resources represented in the VSS tree can either be read-only, represented by the sensor node type,
          or write-only, represented by the actuator node type. In either case the node datatype MUST be a reference to a struct datatype with the following fixed definition:
          <pre><code>
          typedef FileDescriptor struct {
              name string
              hash string
              uid string
          }
          </code></pre>
          The FileDescriptor name member SHALL have a dot separated file extension that identifies the file format.<br>
          The FileDescriptor hash member SHALL be a SHA-1 hex string encoded hash calculated on the content of the file.<br>
          The FileDescriptor uid member SHALL be a hex string encoded random uint32 value.
          Its value shall be unique for each file transfer session, created by the client for download sessions,
          and by the server for upload sessions.<br><br>
          File transfer from client to server, or in the other direction, follows the model shown in the two sequence diagrams below.
          The server exposes two communication channels, a control channel and a data channel.
          The control channel is the channel where the primary VISSv3.0 payloads are communicated, 
          while the data channel is a channel over which the file transfer data is communicated.
          The file transfer data consists of the data from the file, split into appropriate size chunks, and prepended by a header.
          The header consists of three fixed size parameters as shown in the list below.
        <ul>
            <li>uid: 4 bytes. A unique identifier for this file transfer session.</li>
            <li>messageNo: 1 byte. Starting at zero and increasing by one for each file chunk that is transferred.
            Maximum value is 254.</li>
            <li>file chunk size: 4 bytes. The size in bytes of this message, including the header size.</li>
            <li>lastMessage: 1 byte. Indiates whether this message is the last message in the transfer of this file.
          The value zero indicates that this is not the last message, while a non-zero value indicates that it is the last message.</li>

        </ul>
        <figure id="fig-file-download">
          <img src="images/file-download-sequence-diagram.png" alt="VISSv3 file download.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">VISSv3 file download.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        The client SET request on the control channel is exemplified below in the primary payload format.
          <pre><code>
{
  "action": "set",
  "path": "Vehicle.Cabin.Infotainment.privateMap",
  "value": {
    "name": "privateMap.kml",
    "hash": "2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed",
    "uid": "2d878213"
  }
}
          </code></pre>
        The Ok response would in primary payload format look like:
          <pre><code>
{"action": "set", "ts": "2024-08-20T11:30:00Z"}
          </code></pre>
        The client message on the data channel consists of a concatenation of the header and the file chunk.
        The server response on this contains a concatenation of the three parameters shown below.
        <ul>
            <li>uid: 4 bytes. The identifier from the received message.</li>
            <li>messageNo: 1 byte. The message number from the received message.</li>
            <li>status: 1 byte. Indiates whether the message was correctly received or not.
          The value zero indicates that it was correctly received, while a non-zero value indicates that it was not.</li>
        </ul>
        If the SET request on the control channel receives an error message then the client shall not issue any SET requests on the data channel.<br>
        If the client message on the data channel receives an error response then the client hall send the same message again.
        If this results in another error response the client shall terminate the download session.<br>
        

        <figure id="fig-file-upload">
          <img src="images/file-upload-sequence-diagram.png" alt="VISSv3 file upload.">
          <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">VISSv3 file upload.</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        The server GET request and response on the control channel are exemplified below in the primary payload format.
          <pre><code>
{"action": "get", "path": "Vehicle.Cabin.DashCam.Clip"}

{
  "action": "get",
  "data": {
    "path": "Vehicle.Cabin.DashCam.Clip", 
    "dp" {
      "value": {"name": "dashCamClip.mp4", "hash": "2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed", "uid": "2d878213"},
      "ts": "2024-08-20T11:30:00Z"
    }
  },
  "ts": "2025-01-09T12:13:14Z"
}
          </code></pre>
        If the GET request on the control channel receives an error message then the client shall not issue any messages on the data channel.
        Client messages has the same format as the server messages in the file download scenario,
        and as in that case it refers to the previously received message from the server.
        The client must issue an initial message of this type to trigger the server to respond,
        in this first message the message number is set to 255 (all bits set to one).
        The client shall send a final message after receiving the last message from the server.
        If the status is set to zero the server shall respond with only the header from its last message,
        with the chunk size set to zero.<br>
        If the GET request on the data channel receives an error response then the client shall terminate the upload session.
        The client should calculate the file hash on the received file data after the session is concluded
        and compare with the file hash value received in the GET on the control channel.
        If they differ the received file is likely corrupt.<br><br>
        A client may terminate a file download session on the data channel by sending only the header by setting the message number to 255, 
        the chunk size to zero, and the last message to non-zero, on which the server shall respond with status set to zero.<br>
        A file upload session is terminated by the client by issuing a message with the message number set to 255 and the status set to non-zero.<br>
        The node type for the file resource MUST be "actuator" for the download case and "sensor" for the upload case.
        This node must have a fixed datatype,  a struct with the members "name", "hash", and "uid".<br>
        Examples of tree nodes for file download and upload, respectively:
        <pre><code>
        DownloadFile:
          type: actuator
          datatype: Types.Resources.FileDescriptor
          description: File that may be downloaded to the vehicle.

        UploadFile:
          type: sensor
          datatype: Types.Resources.FileDescriptor
          description: File stored at the vehicle that may be uploaded to a client.
          </code></pre>
        The Types.Resources.FileDescriptor definition in the Types tree must mirror the struct definition above.
          </p>
        <h3>Data channel realization</h3>
        <p>
        If file transfer is realized over any supported transport protocol, this must then be shown in the server capabilities tree,
        together with the information needed for a client to access the data channel.
        The default mechanism for realizing a data channel is to assign a port number for it.
        The list below shows the recommended port numbers for the HTTP and WebSocket protocols.
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP port number: 445</li>
            <li>WebSocket port number: 6445</li>
        </ul>
        The recommended mechanism for MQTT is to assing a separate topic name to the data channel.
        The recommended topic name is created by appending "/datachannel" to the topic name of the control channel.
        </p>
        <h3>Alternative based on well-known file transfer protocols</h3>
        <p>
        There exists a number of common file transfer protocols e. g. ftp, sftp, ftps,
        and scp which are widely adopted and have been optimized over many years.
        For larger files these may be a more efficient solution than the integrated VISS protocol.
        The model for using any of these instead builds on that the client can access the needed informattion to connect to the end point
        that is offering the use of the file transfer protocol to access the file.
        This information is available as a struct data point of the tree node.
        This struct should have members similar to what is shown below, depending on what is required to initiate he file transfer.
          <pre><code>
          struct {
              schema string
              port uint32
              path string
              filename string
          }
          </code></pre>
          Schema is the file transfer protocol schema.<br>
          Port is the port number for this service, at least for the initial setup.<br>
          Path is the URL path for this service.<br>
          Filename is the file name of the file to be transferred. It shall include a file extension that defines the format of the file.<br>
          The node type of this tree node shall be "sensor" for files that can only be uploaded to a client, and "actuator" for the file download case.<br>
          Information about the vehicle file system structure, such as the file path information, shall not be exposed to the client.
          The server may use the VSS path as a key into a lookup table for accessing the file in the vehicle file system.
        </p>

    <section id="server-capabilities" class="appendix">
        <h2>Server Capabilities</h2>
        <p>
        A client that wants to connect to a server may be interested in what capabilities the server offers.
        The server shall maintain a separate Server tree which the client can access for this purpose to find out about optional features.
        However, for the client to access this information it must have information about at least one transport protocol that the server supports.
        The VISS API should not make any assumptions on the communication network topology.
        Therefore it should not mandate any transport protocol, instead it should assume that a client can obtain necessary information via out-of-band means
        to configure its communication in order to successfully connect to the vehicle server.
        How that is done is out-of-scope for this specification,
        but as an example a solution may be designed around a cloud based repository to which servers can register their capabilities,
        and clients can inquire about obtaining this information.
        When a client has obtained the information how to connect to the server, then the server MUST respond to read requests for data from the Server tree.
        </p>

        <h3>Server Tree Example</h3>
        <p>
        Below follows an example of a server capabilities tree.
        The tree MUST contain the structures listed below, other parts are optional.
        Server capabilities that extends this specification, or change anything defined in this specification SHALL be declared in the Server tree.
        </p>
       <ul>
            <li>The root node name MUST be Server.</li>
            <li>The Server node MUST have at least have two children named Support and Config.</li>
            <li>The Support node MUST have at least one child named Protocol.</li>
            <li>The Protocol node MUST be an attribute with a string array datatype with members defining the supported transport protocols.</li>
        </ul>

          </code></pre>
          A feature that is supported in at least one configuration shall be registered on the Support branch.
          The Config branch shall contain the information needed for a client to utilize the feature,
          for all configurations that has the feature supported.
          If a server e. g. supports file transfer upload and download then this shall be found at the Support branch,
          and then on the Config branch it shall be registered for which transport protocol(s) it is supported, and e. g. which port number is then used.
          Configuration data that is given a value in the specification documents does not have to be present on the Config branch.

        <h2><dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" id="dfn-dc">Data Compression</dfn></h2>
        <p>
        The primary payload format is JSON, which is text based and thus may lead to large messages in terms of bytes.
        Particularly in subscription scenarios with large number of event messages that are sent off-vehicle this is an undesireable
        feature as the transportation cost may be significant.
        The payload encoding that is supported in this specification provides one possibility of compressing the message size,
        but it does typically not take advantage of specific knowledge of the data being transported.
        The data compression described here does so, as will be described in the following.
        This compression can typically also be combined with a following payload encoding compression step.
        The compression scheme is assymmetric in that it is applied to the response data from the server,
        but not to the client requests.
        The assumption is that this is where it may have the largest impact, particularly in the case of multiple responses on a subscribe request.
        It is also applied per request by an optional parameter that can be included in the Read or Subscribe requests,
        having the following format.
          <pre><code>
          "dc": "A+B"
          </code></pre>
        The expression A+B instructs the server what compression scheme it shall apply to paths and/or timestamps in its response(s) to this request.
        This expression must consist of two values separated by a plus sign, "A + B",
        where the first value A represents which path compression that is selected, and the second value B represents which timestamp compression that is selected.
        The value 0 means that no compression scheme is selected,
        values 1, 2, 4, or 8 represents the compression scheme associated with bits no 0, 1, 2, or 3 in the figure below.
      <figure id="fig-data-compression-scheme-coding">
        <img src="images/data-compression-scheme-coding.jpg" alt="Consent architecture.">
        <figcaption> <span class="fig-title">Data compression scheme coding.</span></figcaption>
      </figure>
      The bits shown in the figure above are assigned to the data compression schemes shown in the list below and described in the following chapters.<br>
      For path compression:
        <ul>
            <li>Bit 0: Static UID path compression.</li>
            <li>Bit 1: Request local path compression.</li>
            <li>Bit 2-3: Reserved for other path compression schemes.</li>
        </ul>
      For timestamp compression:
        <ul>
            <li>Bit 0: Request relative timestamp compression.</li>
            <li>Bit 1-3: Reserved for other timestamp compression schemes.</li>
        </ul>
        See the following chapters for description of the supported compression schemes.<br>
        If the server supports data compression it SHALL declare the compression schemes it supports in its server capabilities tree
        with an expression A+B which is the sum of the values representing the supported schemes.<br>
        If a client request for data compression is not supported, or impossible to realize, the server shall respond with an error message.
        </p>

        <h3>Static UID Path Compression</h3>
        <p>
        To enable the server to support this path compression the VSS tree must include the static UIDs for each node.
        The VSS-Tools exporter tools can be used to assign a static UID to each tree node as described
        <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/blob/master/docs/id.md">here</a>.<br>
        The server will then in the response message(s) replace the VSS path with the static UID value.
        The static UID is represented as a hex value string starting with the characters "0x" then followed by 8 hexadecimal values.
        The client needs to obtain means for decoding the static UIDs into corresponding VSS paths.
        The server shall respond with an error message if the client applies the path compression in its request.
        </p>

        <h3>Request Local Path Compression</h3>
        <p>
        The principle for request local path compression is that the server will in the response message(s) replace the path(s) with an integer index.
        In the case that the request only contains one path reference, then the index is always set to zero.
        For requests that reference more than one path via the usage of the paths filter, the first response from the server will contain the paths uncompressed,
        but any following responses will replace the paths with an index.
        The value of the index is then assigned according to a sorted list of the paths included in the first response,
        i. e. the first path in the sorted list is assigned the value zero, the second the value 1, and so on.
        The index logically represent an integer value but it is in the message payload represented as a string.
        </p>

        <h3>Request Relative Timestamp Compression</h3>
        <p>
        The request relative time stamp compression builds on that response messages always contain a timestamp that represent
        the time when the response message was issued by the server.
        This timestamp will then be the base time that the timestamps for the data point(s) in the response will contain an offset to.
        This offset will be represented as an integer representing milliseconds, prepended with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.
        The uncompressed ISO8601 based timestamp contains 24 characters,
        so for very large offset values leading to low compression rates the server may decide to keep the uncompressed timestamp.
        The client will be able to analyze whether it is a compressed timestamp or not by examining the first character of the string.
        If it is an integer it is an uncompressed timestamp, as the compressed timestamps starts with a plus or a minus character.
        </p>

        <h3>Sequence Diagram Compression Scheme Examples</h3>
        <p>
        The sequence diagram below shows client Get requests for vehicle speed where different combinations of compression schemes are selected.
        The responses mainly show the paths or timestamps that becomes compressed.
        In the first request/response the client requests static UID path compression, in the second request local path compression,
        and in the third and fourth request relative timestamp compression is added together with the respective path compression.

      An example with the complete payloads for a subscribe on two signals with path and timestamp compression are shown below.
      The first payload is the request, the second is the response, then follows the two first event messages.
          <pre><code>
{"action":"subscribe","path":"Vehicle.CurrentLocation","filter":[{"variant":"paths","parameter":["Latitude", "Longitude"]}, {"variant":"timebased","parameter":{"period":"3000"}}], "dc":"2+1","requestId":"286"}

{"action":"subscribe","requestId":"286","subscriptionId":"1","ts":"2025-01-10T11:46:09.955Z"}

{"action":"subscription","data":[{"dp":{"ts":"-123","value":"56.02"},"path":"Vehicle.CurrentLocation.Latitude"},{"dp":{"ts":"-123","value":"12.36"},"path":"Vehicle.CurrentLocation.Longitude"}],"subscriptionId":"1","ts":"2025-01-10T11:46:12.957Z"}

{"action":"subscription","data":[{"dp":{"ts":"-15","value":"56.03"},"path":"0"},{"dp":{"ts":"-15","value":"12.37"},"path":"1"}],"subscriptionId":"1","ts":"2025-01-10T11:46:15.956Z"}
